\section{Visualization Approach}
\label{sec:solution}

Current section covers the visualization approach we have developed to achieve our goals. The subsections give an overview of the research work made,
and introduce two separate visualization methods for each of the input data graphs, Gene Ontology and Cluster.


\subsection{Clustering Visualization --- First Attempt}
\label{sec:probe}

As was discussed before in Section~\ref{sec:dataset_description} cluster analysis result graph is a binary tree.

\begin{quotation}
``A binary tree is a connected acyclic graph such that the degree of each vertex is no more than 3.
A rooted binary tree is such a graph that has one of its vertices of degree no more than 2 singled out as the root.
With the root thus chosen, each vertex will have a uniquely defined parent, and up to two children; however, so far there is insufficient information to distinguish a left or right child.
If we drop the connectedness requirement, allowing multiple connected component in the graph, we call such a structure a forest''~\cite{BINARY_TREE}
\end{quotation}

A simple binary tree is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:simple_binary_tree}

\begin{figure}[h!]

\caption{A simple binary tree graph}
\label{fig:simple_binary_tree}
\end{figure}

There exist several visualization methods for binary trees and more specific methods for cluster results.
The main method for visualizing clusters is a dendrogram. A sample dendrogram visualization produced by MATLAB 7.2 represented in Figure~\ref{fig:dendrogram_1} .

    \includegraphics[scale=0.45]{pictures/polardendrogram.png}
}
\label{fig:dendrograms}
\caption{Cluster visualisations}
\end{figure}


Figure~\ref{fig:polardendrogram} shows a polar dendrogram visualization algorithm of the same cluster tree produced by MATLAB.

One of the main ideas in the beginning was to use a polar dendrogram algorithm for cluster visualization. Figure~\ref{fig:JUNG_radial_layout} shows visualization of the Cluster using native JUNG radial layout algorithm.
Nodes are represented by colors. Red are nodes and white are edges on the black background. As picture shows, algorithm doesn't count nature of the cluster.
That means it is very deep binary tree, not wide as it is common for cluster analysis results, visualization algorithm produces to many edge overlapping.

\caption{Cluster visualization using JUNG radial layout}
\label{fig:JUNG_radial_layout}
\end{figure}


Additionally to visualization issue it has performance issue ---
without any measurement it was seen for an eye that program does not allow smooth interaction.
Low performance issue was in the nature of the JUNG visualization library.
It uses very complex hierarchical structure with many utility classes for each visualized object.
Flexible architecture has a cost and the cost is high memory consumption.
Also JUNG uses Java 2D~\cite{JAVA_2D} which by itself is `heavyweight' because it is a part of the Java AWT --- Abstract Windows Toolkit.

\begin{quotation}
``The Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) is Java's original platform-independent windowing, graphics, and user-interface widget toolkit.
The AWT is now part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) the standard API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for a Java program.
When Sun Microsystems first released Java in 1995, AWT widgets provided a thin level of abstraction over the underlying native user interface.
For example, creating an AWT check box would cause AWT directly to call the underlying native subroutine that created a check box.''~\cite{JAVA_AWT}
\end{quotation}

This technology is outdated and replaced by Swing. In the developed tool all GUI elements are implemented using the Swing API. Here is the brief description and goal of the Swing project:

\begin{quotation}
``Swing is the primary Java GUI widget toolkit. It is part of Sun Microsystems' Java Foundation Classes (JFC)
an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs.
Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit.
Swing provides a native look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms,
and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform.''~\cite{JAVA_SWING}
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
``Since early versions of Java, a portion of the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) has provided platform-independent APIs for user interface components.
In AWT, each component is rendered and controlled by a native peer component specific to the underlying windowing system.
By contrast, Swing components are often described as lightweight because they do not require allocation of native resources in the operating system's windowing toolkit.
The AWT components are referred to as heavyweight components.''~\cite{JAVA_SWING}
\end{quotation}

Reasons to use Swing and more detail information on comparison can be found in.~\cite{AWT_VS_SWING}


Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_jogl_impl} shows improved JUNG radial algorithm and our own visualization implementation using JOGL will be discussed in Section~\ref{sec:opengl}..

The root of the cluster graph has fixed position in the center of the ring. The layout places all leafs evenly on the outer ring based on the distance from root.
Each node is placed on the concentric ring corresponding to its distance to the root node --- level. Each node is radially centered over children.
The number of concentric rings is exactly equal to the number of levels of the graph.

Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_jogl_impl_with_subgraph_1} and Figure~\ref{fig:cluster_jogl_impl_with_subgraph_2}
show cluster visualization and highlighted subgraph (subgraph extraction algorithm was discussed in Section~\ref{sec:algorithm}).
These pictures show the nature of the dataset. Improved version has good performance and better visualization but still has issues.
There are too many elements in the scene and it is impossible to identify separate gene or trace highlighted graph genes.

\subsection{Complete Solution Overview}
\label{sec:complete_solution_overview}

Biologists usually browse the data set randomly or they have a specific GO term in mind to analyze.


For that purpose the tool provides the list of Gene Ontology genes in the alphabet ordered. It is called -- Gene dialog, available from the menu.It is possible to search for specific gene over the list, search provides auto-complete functionality similar to Spotlight~\cite{Spotlight} in Mac OS series of Operation System. Or it is possible to directly click on a particular node in the GO view. Gene dialog also tracks corresponded manual selected node and vice versa -- selected term in the Gene list is highlighted in the Gene Ontology view.


A mouse-over action of the user on a node will display the name of that node with the help of a tool-tip technique. This helps the user to browse the GO and to select a node for further exploration. Extended information is shown in the status bar: it provides the name of the currently selected term of the each view, GO and Cluster Tree, and the name of the currently highlighted.


The GO view displays the nodes as single pixels as already explained earlier. It is pretty hard to perceive a single selected pixel by using color coding only. To make this task easier there is a green circle around the selected node in the GO view, as seen in the third layer of the GO view in Figure~\ref{fig:complete_solution_overview}. This feature also makes it easier to identify the layer the currently selected node belongs to.


After the node has been selected by left-mouse clicking, the sub-graph consisting of all reachable nodes will be calculated. These related nodes, as explained in Subsection~\ref{sec:go}, will be highlighted in yellow in the both views.


There is an optional menu to show the edges of the sub-graph for the Gene Ontology view. At the same time, the corresponding cluster sub-tree will be highlighted with the same color in the Cluster Tree view reflecting the selection made in the GO view. In this way, the user can easily identify the mapping between both views by comparing the highlighted elements.


Note that the closer the selected node is to the GO root, the larger the number of nodes can be accessed from that particular node.
For example, the root node of the GO DAG has access to all nodes of the DAG, this means that if the root node is clicked, the complete DAG will be selected.


In such cases, edge overlapping can not be avoided. Therefore, user of the tool can choose the option to disable the visualization of edges of the Gene Ontology graph if needed to reduce information overflow.


More screen shots of the complete solution in the different states can be found in the Appendix~D.
