\section*{Acknowledgments}
\label{sec:acknowledgments}

I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor Dr. Andreas Kerren and to my co-supervisor Ilir Jusufi.
They encouraged and stimulated me in each step of this work.
Moreover, my greatest gratitude goes to my father Oleksandr and my family that made my study possible,
for their constant moral support even though thousands of kilometers separated us.
Finally, I would like to thank to my best friend Olga for support and patience.
